# Data Practices

This set of resources on **data practices** is made available to OpenDS4All by [datapractices.org](https://datapractices.org) under the 
[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license, and contains
knowledge from many experts and practitioners across the data ecosystem. 

Cources (modules in OpenDS4All jargon) available from [datapractices.org](https://datapractices.org) complements the lessons avaliable in OpenDS4All as it focusses on the role of Data Practitioner that supports many Data Science activities. Because of the close alignment of the content in the two projects, OpenDS4All and DATAPRACTICES.org decided to work closer together and to incorparte relevant content from the other project into thier respective repositories. The content from [datapractices.org](https://datapractices.org) is also not as technical and programming focussed as that in [OpenDS4All](https://github.com/odpi/OpenDS4All), which provides a different perspective on some of the topics already covered by this repository. 

For now, [DATAPRACTICES.org]((https://datapractices.org) and [OpenDS4All](https://github.com/odpi/OpenDS4All) will continue as separate projects under LF: Data and AI, but each project will reference relevant content in the other project and the communities will work together to support each other more closely.
