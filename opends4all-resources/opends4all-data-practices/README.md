# Data Practices

This set of resources on **data practices** is being made available to OpenDS4All by [datapractices.org](https://datapractices.org) under the 
[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license, and contains
knowledge from many experts and practitioners across the data ecosystem. 

Cources (modules in OpenDS4All jargon) available from [datapractices.org](https://datapractices.org) complement the lessons avaliable in OpenDS4All as it focusses on the role of Data Practitioner that supports many Data Science activities. Because of the close alignment of the content in the two projects, [OpenDS4All](https://github.com/odpi/OpenDS4All) and [datapractices.org](https://datapractices.org/) decided to work closer together and to incorparte relevant content from the other project into thier respective repositories. The content from [datapractices.org](https://datapractices.org) is also not as technical and programming focussed as that in [OpenDS4All](https://github.com/odpi/OpenDS4All), which provides a different perspective on some of the topics already covered by this repository. 

For now, [datapractices.org](https://datapractices.org) and [OpenDS4All](https://github.com/odpi/OpenDS4All) will continue as two separate projects under [LF Data and AI](https://lfaidata.foundation/about/join/), but each project will reference relevant content in the other project and the communities will work together to support each other more closely.

### Data Exploration
Too often, many data practitioners dismiss their role in the data ecosystem because they aren’t writing code. Talented spreadsheet users, database admins, database admins, and a host of others all have the ability to contribute heavily to the data work within an organization. This lesson will cover how to be as impactful as possible, even if you aren’t a technical user.
