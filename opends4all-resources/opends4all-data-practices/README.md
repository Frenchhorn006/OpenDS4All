knowledge from many experts and practitioners across the data ecosystem. 

##  Contents

Cources available from [DATAPRACTICES.org](https://datapractices.org) complements the lessons avaliable in OpenDS4All as it focusses on the role of Data Practitioner that supports many Data Science activities. Because of the close alignment of the content in the two projects, OpenDS4All and DATAPRACTICES.org decided to work closer together and to incorparte relevant content from the the other project into thier respective repositories. The content from DATAPRACTICES.org is also not as technical and programming focussed which provides a different perspective on some of the topics already covered by this repository. 

For now, DATAPRACTICES.org and OpenDS4All will continue as separate projects under LF: Data and AI, but each project will reference relevant content in the other project and the communities will work support each other more closely.
