# Data Practices

Cources (modules in OpenDS4All jargon) available from [datapractices.org](https://datapractices.org) complement the lessons avaliable in OpenDS4All as it focusses on the role of the Data Practitioner whose activities support many Data Science activities. Because of the close alignment of the content in the two projects, [OpenDS4All](https://github.com/odpi/OpenDS4All) and [datapractices.org](https://datapractices.org/) decided to work closer together and to incorparte relevant content from the other project into thier respective repositories. The content from [datapractices.org](https://datapractices.org) is also not as technical and programming focussed as that in [OpenDS4All](https://github.com/odpi/OpenDS4All), which provides a different perspective on some of the topics already covered in this repository. 

This set of resources on **data practices** is being made available to OpenDS4All by [datapractices.org](https://datapractices.org) under the 
[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license, and contains
knowledge from many experts and practitioners across the data ecosystem. 

For now, [datapractices.org](https://datapractices.org) and [OpenDS4All](https://github.com/odpi/OpenDS4All) will continue as two separate projects under [LF Data and AI](https://lfaidata.foundation/about/join/), but each project will reference relevant content in the other project and the communities will work together to support each other more closely.

The following topology shows how __data practices__ content is __currently__ organized. This taxonomy is updated as new content is added to the project.

Each category contains one or more modules (courses in datapractices.org)

## Project Lifecycle
### Sourcing Data
Once you have planned out a data project it’s time to gather your resources. There are many things to consider, including where data, documentation, and additional team members can be sourced. This module will help you to understand how to evaluate data project resources including how to aggregate your existing data, the benefits of open data (both using and generating), the pros and cons of purchased data, and how to ensure that your data project can avoid costly pitfalls caused by problems around data provenance, data prep, or anything else.

### Data Exploration
Too often, many data practitioners dismiss their role in the data ecosystem because they aren’t writing code. Talented spreadsheet users, database admins, database admins, and a host of others all have the ability to contribute heavily to the data work within an organization. This module will cover how to be as impactful as possible, even if you aren’t a technical user.

### Analyze and Report
This module will help you to understand how to build models and answer questions in a reproducible way and then deliver the results of that work to your target audience

## Culture / Practice
### Moving from Computer Science to Data Science
Data Scientist is the hottest new job title, and people with many different backgrounds are choosing to pivot their careers to become data practitioners. This module will help those coming from a developer background to understand the similarities and differences between computer science / software development and data science.
